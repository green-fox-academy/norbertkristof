    <h3>Converting Data to Graphical Interface</h3>
    <p><big>I'm Norbert. The founder of the act Norbert Kristof 
        and co-founder of the band American Mercury. I also worked 
        with musical storytelling and creative guidance for brands 
        and musical artists. I just started to learn coding and 
        webdesign so I'm looking forward to use my creative energy 
        in a different industry.</big></p>

    <h2>Definitions</h2>
    <p><strong>Computer: </strong>It is an idealized or physical device implementing 
        a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation 
        on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary 
        output.</p>
    <p><strong>97, 67: </strong>It stands for American Standard Code for Information 
        Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, so it is 
        the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' 
        or an action of some sort.</p>
    <p><strong>RAM: </strong>It is a form of computer data storage which stores 
        frequently used program instructions to increase the general 
        speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items 
        to be read or written in almost the same amount of time 
        irrespective of the physical location of data inside the 
        memory.</p>
    <p><strong>Program Language: </strong>A formal language that specifies a set 
        of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds 
        of output. They generally consist of instructions for a 
        computer and can be used to create programs that implement 
        specific algorithms.</p>
    <p><strong>DNS: </strong>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, 
        services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a 
        private network. It associates various information with domain 
        names assigned to each of the participating entities.</p>
    <p><strong>HTTP: </strong>An application protocol for distributed, collaborative, 
        and hypermedia information systems. It is the foundation 
        of data communication for the World Wide Web. It is the 
        standard protocol to exchange or transfer hypertext.</p>
