// In this lesson, we are going to prove to ourselves that promises are always
// asynchronous.
// First, create a promise using the Promise constructor.
// In the promise’s executor, immediately fulfill the promise with a value of
// 'PROMISE VALUE'.
// After the creation of the promise, pass console.log as the success handler to
// the promise.
// Finally, print out “MAIN PROGRAM” with console.log.

    var promise = new Promise(function (fulfill, reject) {
        fulfill('PROMISE VALUE');
      });
      
      // At this point, the value of promise is already known.
       // If promise is not always asynchronous, console.log would be called with
      // 'PROMISE VALUE' here. This is not the case.
      
      promise.then(console.log);
      
      console.log('MAIN PROGRAM');
